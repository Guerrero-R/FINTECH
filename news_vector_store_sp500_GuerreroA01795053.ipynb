    " # 📌 Objectives\n",
    " \n",
    " By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. **Load and Explore Financial News Data:**\n",
    "    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n",
    "    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n",
    "    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n",
    "    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n",
    "    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n",
    "    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n",
    "    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n",
    "    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n",
    " \n",
    " 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n",
    "    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n",
    "    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."

    "2. Perform filtered semantic search using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    " 👉 **Instructions**:\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 1: Prepare Documents\n",
    " - Combine the TITLE and SUMMARY columns into a single column named EMBEDDED_TEXT.\n",
    " - This combined text will be embedded later.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Step 2: Load Embedding Model\n",
    " - Load the 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from sentence-transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Define CustomVectorStore Class\n",
    " Implement the class with the following methods (functions):\n",
    " \n",
    " - '__init__': Accepts an embedding model, list of documents, and corresponding metadata. Computes and stores embeddings for all documents.\n",
    " - search: Takes a query and returns the top k most similar documents, optionally filtered using metadata.\n",
    "   - If a metadata_filter function is provided, apply it before computing similarity.\n",
    "   - Use cosine similarity to compute distances.\n",
    "   - Return the top k results as tuples of: (document, metadata, similarity score).\n",
    " \n",
    " ✅ **Requirements**:\n",
    " - Ensure the number of documents matches the number of metadata entries.\n",
    " - Make use of sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.\n",
    " \n",
    "You will test your class at the end."
