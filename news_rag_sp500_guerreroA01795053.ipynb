    "In this notebook, you will explore how to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using financial news articles from S&P 500 companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by vectorizing text data, creating a vector store using FAISS, and integrating it with OpenAI's GPT models to answer questions using retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow emulates real-world systems in finance where natural language data (news, filings, analyst reports) are used to support decision-making."

    "# 📌 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n",
    "   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n",
    "   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI’s GPT models.\n",
    "   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n",
    "   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n",
    "   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n",
    "   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n",
    "   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n",
    "   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."
